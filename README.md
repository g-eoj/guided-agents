This is a fork of the awesome [smolagents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents) library.
The goal of this fork is to integrate structured output.

See gaia_example.py for a starting point on the [GAIA benchmark](https://huggingface.co/datasets/gaia-benchmark/GAIA).
It is set up to run models locally through MLX and also has an example of using vLLM.
